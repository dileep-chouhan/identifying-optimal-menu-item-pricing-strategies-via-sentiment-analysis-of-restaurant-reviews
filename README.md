# Identifying Optimal Menu Item Pricing Strategies via Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

## Overview


This project analyzes online restaurant reviews to identify correlations between customer sentiment and menu item pricing.  The goal is to develop data-driven insights that can help restaurants optimize their menu pricing strategies by understanding which price points yield the highest customer satisfaction for specific items.  The analysis involves sentiment analysis of review text, coupled with sales data (assumed to be provided in a suitable format), to determine the relationship between price, volume, and customer feedback.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NLTK (or similar NLP library - specify if different)

## How to Run....

This project requires Python 3 and several libraries listed above.  To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main analysis script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Note:**  You will need to provide a suitable dataset in the format specified within the code (likely a CSV file containing review text, item names, prices, and potentially sales data).  The exact file path may need to be adjusted within `main.py`.

## Example Output....

The script will print key findings to the console, including summary statistics on sentiment scores for different price ranges of menu items and any significant correlations identified.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., scatter plots showing the relationship between price and sentiment, bar charts showing average sentiment for different price brackets).  These plots are saved in the `output` directory as PNG files (e.g., `sentiment_vs_price.png`, `average_sentiment_by_price_bracket.png`).  The specific outputs will depend on the input dataset.


## Data Requirements....

The project expects a dataset with at least the following columns:

* `item_name`: The name of the menu item.
* `price`: The price of the menu item.
* `review_text`: The text of the customer review.
*(Optional)* `sales_volume`: Number of times the item was sold.
